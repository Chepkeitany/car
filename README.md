# Composition

This is a simple project that illustrates composition, an important concept in Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

Composition is the practice of creating other class objects in your class. In such a scenario, the class which creates the object of the class is known as the owner and is responsible for the lifetime of that object.
In composition, the lifetime of the owned object depends on the lifetime of the owner.

In this project, a car is composed of engine, tires, and doors.
